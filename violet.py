#Variables are names given to data items that may take on one or more values during a program's runtime
#x=5 where x is the variable that stores the value 5.
#We define variables by assigning them a value using the assignment operator =
x=5
y="John"
# The print function in Python is used to display output on the screen.
# Here it displays what is stored in x and y
# It takes one or more values,converts them to text and prints them to console
print(x)
print(y)
#Constant in Python are variables that should remain unchanged throughout execution
#Constant are written in upper case letters egPI=3.14159 or MAX_SCORE=100.
#Constant help make code easier to understand and maintain
PI=3.14159
radius=5
area=PI*radius*radius
print(area)
